Hermann's turtles are ideal for beginners. They are very autonomous turtles and have a very good sense of direction. If you leave them in your garden, they can feed on leaves, flowers, fruits, worms and even snails on their own. They have a life expectancy of around 40 years. Enough to keep you busy for several years.
