Docile and affectionate, the Persian cat is one of the most popular breeds, especially as it is a cat with an extraordinary interior. Like all long-haired cats, it should be brushed regularly to prevent its fur from tangling. The coat of Persian cats comes in a wide range of colors, but if you're interested in Persians with white fur and blue eyes, beware: these traits are often a sign of deafness.
