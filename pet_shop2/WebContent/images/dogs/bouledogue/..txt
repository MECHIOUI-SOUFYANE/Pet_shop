This bulldog hates heat and is vulnerable to sunburn. He needs to be outside at least three times a day and requires one long walk a week. It should be brushed every day at the time of moulting and given a bath once every two months. Check his eyes regularly, as the bulldog is predisposed to glaucoma. The birth, in this animal, is sometimes difficult because of the large head of the puppy. It is then necessary to resort to a delivery by cesarean section, but in this case, the puppies must be bottle-fed.
